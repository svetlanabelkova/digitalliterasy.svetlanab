# Timbre, in music, also known as tone color or tone quality from psychoacoustics is the precieved sound quality of a musical note, sound or tone. 
# Timbre distinguishes different types of sound production, such as choir voice and musical instruments, such as string instruments, wind instruments, and percussion instruments. It also enables listeners to distinguishes different instruments in the same category (e.g. an oboe and a clarnet, both woodwind instruments).

# The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include spectrum and envelope. Singers and instrumental musicians can change the timbre of the music they are singing/playing by using different singing or playing techniques. For example, a violinist can use different bowing styles or play on different parts of the string to obtain different timbres (e.g., playing sul tasto produces a light, airy timbre, whereas playing sul ponticello produces a harsh, even and aggressive tone). On electric guitar and electric piano, performers can change the timbre using effects units and graphic equalizers.
